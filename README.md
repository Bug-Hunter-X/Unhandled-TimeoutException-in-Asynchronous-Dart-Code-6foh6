# Unhandled TimeoutException in Asynchronous Dart Code

This example demonstrates a scenario where a TimeoutException might occur in an asynchronous operation, and how to handle it using `try-catch` blocks. The original code lacks proper handling for this exception.

The solution provides improved exception handling, ensuring that exceptions are caught and handled gracefully.  This is critical for robust applications to avoid unexpected crashes.
